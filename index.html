    <p>
      Gorilla, the Gorillas, is a genus of monkeys belonging to the family Hominidae. These are the closest monkeys to humans after chimpanzees, since gorilla DNA is 98.4% identical to that of humans.
      Gorilla is the largest of the eight genera of the hominoid super-family. Males, in particular, can develop a colossal physical strength.
      Gorillas live in groups in tropical or subtropical forests, where they feed on plants and sometimes on insects. Their presence covers a small percentage of Africa and they are endangered species. On the found at very varied altitudes. The mountain gorilla lives in the cloud forests of the Virunga Mountains, from an altitude of 2,200 to 4,300 meters. Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps.

        <h3>Things to know</h3>
        <img src="images/md/md-image-02.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Another thing that makes chimpanzees and humans remarkable is our culture, or all the learned traditions, behaviors, and values passed through generations. Because primates learn from other members in their social groups, different geographical populations of chimpanzees and humans exhibit predispositions to different behaviors, making groups culturally distinct from one another. </p>

        <h3>The Gorillas</h3>
        <img src="images/md/md-image-03.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Gorillas live in the dense forests where they are active during the day. While flat country gorillas prefer moist tropical forests, mountain gorillas tend to live in secondary forests. Mountain gorillas are mostly on the ground. Gorillas in flat countries often climb trees in search of food, even heavy males frequently climb trees up to 20 meters high. On the ground, the gorillas walk on all fours by leaning on the phalanges of their hands and not on the palms like other monkeys more frankly quadrupeds (see Locomotion on the joints). Every night, to rest, they build a nest of leaves in just five minutes. Mountain gorillas have their nests on the ground most of the time, the gorillas of the flat countries in the trees </p>

        <h3>How they live</h3>
        <img src="images/md/md-image-04.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Gorillas live in groups headed by an adult male called "silver back". The composition of the groups varies from two to thirty individuals, the average being between 10 and 15. In general, each group is composed of an adult male (male on a silver back), one or more younger males ( black-backed males), several adult females (five to six), and a few small ones. When there are several males in a group, only the dominant male can mate. </p>

        <h3>The groups</h3>
        <img src="images/md/md-image-05.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The behavior of groups is variable, temporary separations for foraging are common. Unlike many other kinds of primates, it is most often females who leave the group to find another. Groups usually last a long time, sometimes there are struggles between males to know who will lead the group. If a new male wins, he kills the offspring of the loser. In this infanticide, we can see a biological benefit from the fact that lactating females can not conceive and, after the death of their young, are quickly ready to copulate again. </p>

        <h3>The kind of life</h3>
        <img src="images/md/md-image-07.jpg" alt="">
        <p>The territorial instinct is undeveloped, several groups seek their food in the same places but by avoiding each other. Since their food consists mostly of leaves, they do not have to go very far to find it, first because the leaves abound, then because they are not very nutritious and often difficult to digest, which forces them to long periods of rest. Gorillas have a series of sounds, cries, attitudes and grunts that they use to recognize members of their group and strangers and as a means of intimidation. We know their way to hit the chest. It was once thought that this behavior is reserved for older males, and is found in all individuals. It is probably used to signal its position, or it is a welcome ritual. In early 2009, one of the largest ever studies on great apes, conducted by scientists at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, indicates the existence of a common language in all gorillas based on 102 signs </p>

        <h3>The alimentation</h3>
        <img src="images/md/md-image-09.jpg" alt="">
        <p>Gorillas feed mainly on plants: mostly fruits, shoots, stems, leaves, but sometimes also insects (termites and others). Thanks to this diet and their many displacements, the gorillas participate in the regeneration of the forests. By ingesting a large quantity of seeds and rejecting them in forest gaps, the gorillas actively participate in forest regeneration. </p>
